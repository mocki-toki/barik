**Popup** — a new feature that allows opening an extended and interactive view of a widget (e.g., the battery charge indicator widget) by clicking on it. Currently, popups are available for the following **barik** widgets: Now Playing, Network, Battery, and Time (Calendar).

We want to make **barik** more useful, powerful, and convenient, so feel free to share your ideas in [Issues](https://github.com/mocki-toki/barik/issues/new), and contribute your work through [Pull Requests](https://github.com/mocki-toki/barik/pulls). We'll definitely review everything!

Other changes:

- Added a new **Now Playing** widget — allowing control of music in desktop applications like Apple Music and Spotify. We welcome your suggestions for supporting other music services: https://github.com/mocki-toki/barik/issues/new
