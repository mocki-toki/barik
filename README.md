**barik** is a lightweight macOS menu bar replacement. If you use [**yabai**](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) or [**AeroSpace**](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) for tiling WM, you can display the current space in a sleek macOS-style panel with smooth animations. This makes it easy to see which number to press to switch spaces.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.6+

## Quick Start

1. Install **barik** via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```sh
brew install --cask mocki-toki/formulae/barik
```

Or you can download from [Releases](https://github.com/mocki-toki/barik/releases), unzip it, and move it to your Applications folder.

2. _(Optional)_ To display open applications and spaces, install [**yabai**](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) or [**AeroSpace**](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) and set up hotkeys. For **yabai**, you'll need **skhd** or **Raycast scripts**. Don't forget to configure **top padding** â€” [here's an example for **yabai**](https://github.com/mocki-toki/barik/blob/main/example/.yabairc).

3. Hide the system menu bar in **System Settings** and uncheck **Desktop & Dock â†’ Show items â†’ On Desktop**.

4. Launch **barik** from the Applications folder.

5. Add **barik** to your login items for automatic startup.

**That's it!** Try switching spaces and see the panel in action.

## Configuration

When you launch **barik** for the first time, it will create a `~/.barik-config.toml` file with an example customization for your new menu bar.

```toml
theme = "system" # system, light, dark

[widgets]
displayed = [ # widgets on menu bar
    "default.spaces",
    "spacer",
    "default.network",
    "default.battery",
    "divider",
    # { "default.time" = { time-zone = "America/Los_Angeles", format = "E d, hh:mm" } },
    "default.time",
]

[widgets.default.spaces]
space.show-key = true        # show space number (or character, if you use AeroSpace)
window.show-title = true
window.title.max-length = 50

[widgets.default.battery]
show-percentage = true
warning-level = 30
critical-level = 10

[widgets.default.time]
format = "E d, J:mm"
calendar.format = "J:mm"

calendar.show-events = true
# calendar.allow-list = ["Home", "Personal"] # show only these calendars
# calendar.deny-list = ["Work", "Boss"] # show all calendars except these
```

Currently, you can customize the order of widgets (time, indicators, etc.) and adjust some of their settings. Soon, youâ€™ll also be able to add custom widgets and completely change **barik**'s appearanceâ€”making it almost unrecognizable (hello, r/unixporn!).

## Future Plans

I'm not planning to stick to minimal functionalityâ€”exciting new features are coming soon! The roadmap includes full style customization, the ability to create custom widgets or extend existing ones, and a public **Store** where you can share your styles and widgets.

Soon, you'll also be able to place widgets not just at the top, but at the bottom, left, and right as well. This means you can replace not only the menu bar but also the Dock! ðŸš€

And very soon, I'll introduce a new way to use barik â€” **Popup** ([#24](https://github.com/mocki-toki/barik/issues/24)). Stay tuned!

## Why Aren't the Space Indicators Clickable?

[#7](https://github.com/mocki-toki/barik/issues/7)

The space indicators are not clickable because barik is designed to be keyboard-driven. Use keyboard shortcuts to switch spaces, for example with [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) or [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) scripts.

## Where Are the Menu Items?

[#5](https://github.com/mocki-toki/barik/issues/5), [#1](https://github.com/mocki-toki/barik/issues/1)

Menu items are not supported. The original philosophy of barik is to minimize unnecessary information and emphasize keyboard-driven control. However, you can use [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), which supports menu items through an interface similar to Spotlight. I personally use it with the `option + tab` shortcut, and it works very well.

If youâ€™re accustomed to using menu items from the system menu bar, simply move your mouse to the top of the screen to reveal the system menu bar, where they will be available.
